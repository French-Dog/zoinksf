  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm just a random guy who likes to walk around San Francisco. I started documenting "ZOINK" graffiti because it's everywhere, and no one seems to know whoâ€™s behind it.</p>
  <p>This is a fun passion project that lets me explore the city and track patterns in graffiti.</p>
